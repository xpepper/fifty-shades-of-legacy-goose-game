# Goose Game API
The rule of this classic game are explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose).

### Add a player to the game
To add a new player to the game, send a POST request like this:

`POST /players`

with a JSON body like `{ "name": "Paolo", "nickname": "gooser"}`

And the response should be something like 

`{"id": "95df85f8-e342-4420-8917-187d00870db5", "name": "Paolo", "nickname": "gooser"}`

Game starts when exactly four players join.
Players must have a unique nickname.

### Playing the game

The game will start as soon as four players join the game.

During your turn, you can roll the dice by sending a POST request like this: 

`POST /players/95df85f8-e342-4420-8917-187d00870db5/roll`

where `95df85f8-e342-4420-8917-187d00870db5` should be your player id.

The response will contain the roll result, your new position and a message, like this one:

`{"roll":[5, 4], "position":21, "message": "Paolo moves from 12 to 21." }`
